# Full Web App React Nodejs w/ GraphQL Tailwind and Docker 

## Car Place web app
This is an amazingly looking Reactjs website with Tailwind CSS, styled-components, and Apollo GraphQL alongside its Node.js/Express.js Server Side app or putting together a full dedicated Car Models GraphQL API built on top of Nest.js Framework. The final steps are Dockerizing the whole Stack with MySQL Docker image and using the Nginx Rever proxy to serve the running Nodejs applications on the server.
